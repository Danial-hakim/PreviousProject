# Introduction

## Who are we
We are a small group of students who are now in our second year under the course of computer games development in Institute of Technology Carlow.The team consist of 4 members and the members are as following : Stephen Hurley , Izabela Zelek , Rauls Bergs and Danial Nor Azman.The name that was given to the team is Team B.

## What is the purpose of this document
This research report is for the purpose of compiling the decisions we as the group have made into one single documentation. The research report should serve as the primary source of inquiry when it comes to what should and should not be included into the project.

## Why are we doing this project
This project is part of our software engineering module which accounts of 10 percent of our end of year mark. This project will aid us in getting a much better understanding of the grounded principals of software engineering as well as practicing clear and intentional communication between our teammates.

# Game description
Boggle is a word game invented by Allan Turoff and originally distributed by Parker Brothers. The game is played using a plastic grid of 16 lettered dice, in which players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent letters. It is a timed word game in which players have 3 minutes to find as many connected words as possible from the face up letters resting in the 16 cube grid. When the timer runs out, players compare their lists of words and remove any words found by multiple players. Points are then awarded for remaining words, depending on how many letters are in the word. Multiple versions of the game exist, such as a version of a 5x5 grid containing 25 dice rather than the standard 4x4 grid with 16 dice.

# Game rules
In the original board game, each person has paper and a pencil. The board game includes a cube grid containing 16 letter cubes. The cube grid is covered with the dome and the cubes are shook. The player turns the grid right-side up and makes sure all cubes have one face up, once finished the player removes the dome and immediately starts the timer. Each player should be silent throughout the game. Every player creates their own words on their own paper. The players should not see each other’s paper. Words can only be created using connected letters. The letters may be horizontally, vertically or diagonally beside each other and the word can be spelled in any direction. A letter cube can only be used once per word, the word cannot be the name of a person or place. The players must stop writing when the timer runs out. All players take turns reading out their words, only unique words – words nobody else has – will be scored. The scoring is as follows, 3 and 4 letter words give 1 point, 5 letter words give 2 points, 6 letter words give 3 points, 7 letter words give 5 points, and 8+ words give 11 points. The winner is the player who gets the highest amount of points. Ties are usually broken by counting the amount of long words the tied players have.
